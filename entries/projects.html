    I wrote web & intranet crawlers. Some companies wanted to keep track of their internal data.<br><br>
        Those projects where sometimes challenging, because not every data source was serialized -- so I had to balance between generic and more customized approaches.<br><br>

    During working with (web) crawlers, sometimes the solution included to work with an UI automation tool. For web, the choice was Selenium.<br><br>
        For native desktop applications (like .NET) I've worked with TestComplete. Getting reliable tests is not trivial -- but possible with some dedication and experience.<br><br>

        Getting an early feedback, if the program is still working, is quite helpfull.<br>
        Unit tests and some component tests providing that short feedback loop, but E2E/UI tests are on some other level.<br><br>

        I've build an test pipeline for UI tests with TestExecute, TestRail and Jenkins.<br><br>
        It was quite big project, because there where so many small parts. And since it was a .NET application, I had to deal with all the beautiful fallpits from Windows.<br><br>
