I'm tinkering with PCs since ~2004. Where 256 MB of RAM was basically a super computer for a little kid like me.

After some back and forth in my goals & interests, I picked up learning Python in 2019.
And since then, I'm building various stuff. Mostly crawlers, task/test automation and tooling.

On my journey I learned (and still learning) some neat stuff! Check my project section for more.
